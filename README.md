5V 2A Power Supply using the TI TPS54202

Copyright (c) 2025 Phillip Dimond

Uses my personal favourite switching controller, good for up to 2A.. Changing the FB resistors will change the ouput voltage though efficiency may suffer. Input coltage is designed to be 9V to 25V DC

The Gerbers are laid out in the correct format for JLCPCB, you can simply upload the ZIP file to them and order the boards.
